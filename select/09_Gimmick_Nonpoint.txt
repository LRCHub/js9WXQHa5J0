Chased by a dark cloud negativity the story of my
So called life questions no answers no actions just words
I can't find a direction to turn no easy steps the road
To success you keep me depressed I'm always depressed
Hang with me hand and hand you changed search to rearrange the way
We communicate
A god made human is what you are yet you're acting like a god
Retched is the plot stirred in the pot just want to be active
Hands to hands you change need to be noticed look back to focus
Hocus pocus you're done
On a dim you stand no weakness to ignore ego like mentality you talkin
Mighty high you live to love to lie can't understand why give me
Another try look in the mirror boy you're nothin but a toy you live
A gimmick you're like a puppet
Hang with me hand and hand you changed search to rearrange
The way we communicate
A god made human is what you are yet
You're acting like a god
Retched is the plot stirred in the pot
Just want to be active hands to hands you change need to be noticed
Look back to focus hocus pocus you're done I made you
I broke you believed you realize this time I came prepared
Pensando que decirte a ti porque eres asi con tu gente ie lo digo
Cantando si tu quieres hablando por que to entiendo tu clase de gente
