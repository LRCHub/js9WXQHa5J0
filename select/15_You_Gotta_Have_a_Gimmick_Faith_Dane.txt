Till They Call The Cops Out

If You Wanna Get A Hand.

If You Wanna Get Ahead.

So I Uh... And I Uh...
And I Uh... Uh... Uh...
But I Do It With A Horn...
Once I Was A Schleppa,
Now I'm Miss Mazzeppa,
With My Revolution In Dance.
You Gotta Have A Gimmick
If You Wanna Have A Chance!

'Cause If You Got A Gimmick
Gypsy Girl, You Got It Made.
