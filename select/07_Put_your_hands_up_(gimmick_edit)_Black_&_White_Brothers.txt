Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
It was not so long ago
They sat on information
Every Saturday night
On favorite radio
The party's jumpin'
And the vibe is so strong
Throw your hands in the air
Lift your head up high
No, no, you got to sing along
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air

I've got the feeling
Who wants to wiggle a chair?
Say, I can feel it
You know you can
I got my groove on
And I'm ready to go
Check out my vibe, girl
But don't touch my radio
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
Put hands up in the air
