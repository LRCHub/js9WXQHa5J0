What do we need?
What do we need?
I wish someone would tell us what we need!

We need a gimmick
Pretty little gimmick
A fool-proof plan to gain the trust
Of the human race
After all...
We come from outer space
(And we smell like shit!)
No more shame; it's time for fame
Nothin' to lose, everything to gain

We've seen it, heard it, felt it, thought it, sought it
Lived it all before
We've read it, watched it, bought it, stole it, sold it
Now we just want more
Listen up!
We won't be let down anymore

Now they've got a killer plan
And it just might be crazy enough to work

When it all began
They were desperate, they were prideful
They were reckless, pitiful scum (and never mindful)
Never thought enough to realize that
Everything is just a joke

We're at it again
Just us and the friends
We know what this is
No need to lie
We push that boulder up the hill...

We need a gimmick
Squishy little gimmick
The perfect way to win the heart
Of the human race
After all...
They live in the comfort zone
(And they're a bunch of dicks!)
Watch them watch themselves on hi-def plasma television screens
We made a human costume for a goblin
Best to hide the green

Now they've got a killer plan
And it just might be crazy enough to work

When it all began
They were desperate, they were prideful
They were reckless, pitiful scum (and never mindful)
Never thought enough to realize that
Everything is just a joke

But that was then...

Now they've got a clever plan
And it ain't half-bad
It's got to work;
It's just what they need
They are temperate, they are mindful
They are zealous, wonderful chums (took off the blindfold)
Never thought enough to realize that
Everything is still a joke

We're at it again
Just us and the friends
We know what this is
No need to lie
We push that boulder up the hill...
...but then it rolls back down again

Over and over
The coldest of shoulders
They're missing the point
Misguided drones
They keep checking their phones
As if it really fuckin' matters...

We skinned a dog to make its hair
We peeled a preschool and stole their skin
Wow, ain't he looking debonair
Just smash the face, he'll blend right in

Ooh! now he's getting on the ship
We built a rocket, to send him to earth
No need to freak, it's just a trip
I think it's about time you got a grip

We're at it again
Just us and the friends
We know what this is
No need to lie
We push that boulder up the hill...
...but then it rolls back down again

Over and over
The coldest of shoulders
They're missing the point
Misguided drones
They keep checking their phones
As if it really fuckin' matters...

What do we got?
What do we got?

...a gimmick!
